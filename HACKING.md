## Testing

### Integration testing
The Bean SDK contains integration tests that are intended for use with physical Bean hardware. 
For information on using/running/building these tests, consult Apple's documentation: 
[Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/testing_with_xcode/testing_4_running_tests/testing_4_running_tests.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014132-CH5-SW1)

To run these tests from the command-line, especially for CI, consider using xctool.
