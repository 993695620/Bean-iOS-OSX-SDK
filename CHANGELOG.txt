---------------------------------
1.0.0
Released on 2016-03-18
---------------------------------

FEATURES:
* Unit tests
  * PTDIntelHex
  * PTDHardwareLookup
  * PTDUtils
  * Stateless test utilities
* Integration tests
  * Blink LED
  * Upload sketch
  * Update firmware
  * Device Info profile is present
* Asymmetric firmware update support
  We migrated to asymmetric firmware updates for Bean's CC2540. These updates
  give us more program space which lets us include more Bluetooth features,
  such as HID over BLE, MIDI over BLE, ANCS and observer mode.
  This feature is leveraged by Bean Loader for OS X and iOS.
* PTDIntelHex helper added
* PTDHardwareLookup helper added
* PTDUtils helper added (uncategorized utility methods)
* SDK can automatically reconnect to a disconnected Bean
  Used by Bean Loaders to reconnect to a Bean during a multi-step asymmetric
  firmware update.

IMPROVEMENTS:
* Removed firmware files from SDK
  Bean Loaders are now responsible for maintaining their own bundled firmware
  and keeping it in sync with their bundled Arduino Core.
* Device hardware identification is much more robust. Bean Loaders should use
  PTDHardwareLookup logic in the future.

BUG FIXES:
* Device Info properties (Bean hardware and firmware version) no longer block
  during a connection or firmware update event
